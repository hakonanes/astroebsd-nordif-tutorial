abstract = {Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) is a technique used to measure crystallographic features in the scanning electron microscope. The technique is highly automated and readily accessible in many laboratories. EBSD pattern indexing is conventionally performed with raw electron backscatter patterns (EBSPs). These patterns are software processed to locate the band centres (and sometimes edges) from which the crystallographic index of each band is determined. Once a consistent index for many bands are obtained, the crystal orientation with respect to a reference sample {\&} detector orientation can be determined and presented. Unfortunately, due to challenges related to crystal symmetry, there are limited available pattern indexing approaches and this has likely hampered open development of the technique. In this manuscript, we present a new method of pattern indexing, based upon a method with which satellites locate themselves in the night sky, and systematically demonstrate its effectiveness using dynamical simulations and real experimental patterns. The benefit of releasing this new algorithm is demonstrated as we utilise this indexing process, together with dynamical solutions, to provide some of the first accuracy assessments of an indexing solution. In disclosing a new indexing algorithm, and software processing tool-kit, we hope this opens up EBSD developments to more users. The software code and example data is released alongside this article for 3rd party developments.},
